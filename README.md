#Analysis goes here!

# One thing that I knew would be an observable difference between variables before analysis was the test score 
#discrepancies between Charter and District schools. Charter schools scored significantly higher for both math and
#reading as well as their percentage of students passing the stated courses, with math in particular showing a large
#gulf between the types of schools. This can be explained by the prerogative of Charter schools to be selective in
#whom they admit to their institution. The ethics of this are debatable as some will point to the assumed "success" of
#Charter schools based on test scores alone without taking into account their heightened standards of admission, whether
#those standards be academic or monetary.

# We can also see a negative correlation between school size and test scores, again probably in part due to the fact
#that Charter schools tend to be smaller than District schools, and so the same logic applies as did with the
#differences between school type and average scores/pass rates. Interestingly the larger average per-student budget of
#the District schools did not show to improve scores enough to pull even with Charter schools. It could be that some or
#all of the surplus money being spent by District schools could be for maintainance or renovations that might otherwise 
#be undertaken by a private donor at a Charter school.
